##Katyaryna Matsveyeva

Hallow everyone!
My name is **Kathrine Matveyeva**.

###About me
I am 31 years old, and currently reside in Minsk, Belarus.
Now I’m RS-school student, studying Front End / JavaScript development.

I like everything related to art, especially contemporary art. I like listening podcasts,reading books and playing board games. I’m really good in cross stitching and house planting ;)

Participate as a volunteer in local art projects and helping homeless animals.

###Education and work experience
I graduated from St-Petersburg Polytechnic University in 2012, majoring power engineering. My core specialization was   power plants, boilers, and reactor engineering.

I have been working for 8 years in governmental Joint Stock Venture called “Bern” (which stands for “Belenorgoremnaladka”); where I was responsible for designing power plants equipment and engineering support of power plants reconstruction.
###Summary, skills and why Front end
Several months ago, I decided to change my career and try myself in Front-end development.
Why Front end, you may ask?
I am a visual person by nature, and I like to see the results of my own work instantly.
I am not afraid of a hard work and tasks of any technical complexity.
Also, I considered that new professional sphere should be fast growing and rapidly changing.
Previously, I had an experience in MathCad programming, 3d modeling, creating graphical layouts; rich experience with creating and editing complex technical documentation. I’m good team player, proficient in interaction with stakeholders and customers
So I decided that Front end would be a good option. 
I got excellent feedback about RS-school from friends who are working in the industry. So, I decided to give it a try.

###Study project
By the moment, most challenging of my study projects is OnlineZoo.
Actually, it is my first project of such complexity. I deeply dive into the process and really enjoy it.
In the process of creating this project, I learned how to:
-	Build adaptive, reliable layouts.
-	Master usage of flexes and grids.
-	Use CSS combinators to create more complex visual effects and elements behavior even without JavaScript
-	Got familiar with troubleshooting and debugging using Chrome Developer Tools and WebStorm IDE
     Added just some of js bells and whistles… and voilà, my son is watching the online pandas broadcast. It is amazing! :)

Last weeks were tough, but I have a great pleasure to be in study process.
I’m ready to improve my skills, learn new tools, frameworks and technologies, deepen my knowledge and give myself up to the process.
 I am ready to start working full day almost tomorrow.
